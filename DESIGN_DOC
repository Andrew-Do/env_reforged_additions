Problem:
    BB outside of it's interesting tactical combat is lacking in depth for managing a mecenary company. Of issues to note is lack of world depth where many things are repeatable and the same. Fixes to increase immersion would be:

        1. economy rework, to make it feel like those old times where most people are poor and struggling to get by
        2. faction rework - a world that functions indepently from the player and lets them react to events or help them occur. faction events and conflicts would cause contracts to arise.
        3. you mostly function as a band of mercenaries roaming around, but what if we decreased the number of cities and added more problems to solve? that way you could design more interesting and unique cities. Stronghold is an interesting mod, but as a mercernary company, how realistic is it to build your own city with those resources? It'd be more interesting play to be able to gain relations with a faction or city and find a city to call your home base, and then create a larger mecernary company with headquarters. You can then delegate teams to complete tasks for you or choose to handle difficult tasks yourself.
        4. Heroes. Unique npcs that you can encounter, bargain, fight with in campaign. Some of them can even be leaders of a crisis. ie. necromancer faction gains enough power that it snowballs and creates the undead crisis. Or intelligent orc that learns magic is born and grows up, and rallies the orcs to destroy the humans.
